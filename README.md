# Find It! 2

Forked from SamSamTS's original Find It! mod.  

## Development Environment  
Visual Studio 2019 should be able to set up everything automatically. Just open the .csproject file. Andreas Pardeike's [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) patching library is a needed dependency. If Visual Studio doesn't set it up for you, you can get Harmony 2 via boformer's [CitiesHarmony](https://github.com/boformer/CitiesHarmony) nuget package.  

## Pull Requests
Pull requests are welcome. I write code in other languages at work but I only write C# code for modding this game, so the code here isn't well written. Legacy code from the original Find It lacks of documentation too(I'm slowly working on this). If it is just a few lines of code, you can send in the pull request directly. If it is going to be a big change, you can create a new issue for discussion before you start working on it.  

## Future plans
