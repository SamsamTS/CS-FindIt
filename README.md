## Development Environment  
Visual Studio 2019 should be able to set up everything automatically. Just open the .csproject file. Andreas Pardeike's [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) patching library is a needed dependency. If Visual Studio doesn't set it up for you, you can get Harmony 2 via boformer's [CitiesHarmony](https://github.com/boformer/CitiesHarmony) nuget package.  

## Pull Requests
Pull requests are welcome. If it is just a few lines of code, you can send in the pull request directly. If it is going to be a big change, you can create a new issue for discussion before you start working on it.
