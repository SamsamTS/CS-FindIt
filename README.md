# Find It! Fix  

Forked from SamSamTS's original Find It! mod.  


## Release Notes
New in v1.6.2:
- New ploppable tabs & icon change. Some DLC buildings are moved to new tabs.

New in v1.6.1:
- New filter checkbox: choose to include/exclude vanilla assets and custom assets (from Steam workshop subscription or saved in local asset folder) in the search results.

- More flexible search by growable size: You can search for sizes like 1xAll, 2xAll, 3xAll and 4xAll. Notice: CO named their assets inconsistently. For example a building was mistakenly named as 3x4 when it is actually 4x3. The search is based on the actual dimension not the name.
 
New in v1.6(first release):
- Fix some known minor issues in the original Find It.
- New filter tabs for ECO growables.
- Buildings added in the newer DLCs now are included and can be found under the filter tabs.

## Future plans
- Rearrange filter tabs to match asset editor  
- Multi-language support  
- Investigate Extra Landscaping Tools incompatibility issues  
- Investigate shortcut conflicts with the bulldoze tool
- Improve performance(hopefully)
