If anyone wants to help me test an experimental new feature for find it(sort assets by most recently downloaded), here's the link to the alpha version. Just download the zip, extract and copy the FindIt folder to the local mod folder. Remember to unsubscribe other versions of find It. This new feature should help you find your recently subscribed assets very fast(unless you reinstall the game and Steam would just redownload every thing at once). I've tested it on Windows and it worked as expected, but I am not sure about other platforms (especially macOS)
